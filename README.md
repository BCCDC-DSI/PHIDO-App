# PHIDO-App


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/146ba070-048d-442a-b5dd-f5c2cf5768f3)


PHIDO is a statistical algorithm that determines whether sequence of weekly case counts are unusual compared to ***any trends shown over the previous five years***. More specifically, it estimates the ***expected count*** for each epi-week based on  counts from the prior epi weeks. When an observed count falls outside the probability distribution of the expected count, an alert is generated. Different thresholds may be set for different diseases; users may interact with the menu to explore the effects of the threshold. Note that rare diseases will always lead to an alert. 

In spring of 2024, [PHIDO-App](https://bccdc.shinyapps.io/PHIDO/) was implemented with R Shiny that would allow users to interactively understand the alerts generated by the PHIDO algorithm, e.g. functions:
- To explore counts and alerts by geography
- To examine the trendtimes for a particular disease-region combination
- To aggregate analysis data based on gender
- ...  


## Purpose of this repo

This repo provides links to key documents and step-by-step instructions for different tasks required for maintaining the [PHIDO-App](https://bccdc.shinyapps.io/PHIDO/).

A copy of the [Standard Operating Procedure](sop.md) for use by data analysts.
