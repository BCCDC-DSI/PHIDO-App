## Purpose

PHIDO is a statistical algorithm that determines whether sequence of weekly case counts are unusual compared to any trend shown over the previous five years. 

In spring of 2023, [PHIDO-App](https://bccdc.shinyapps.io/PHIDO/) was implemented with R Shiny that would allow users to interactively understand the alerts generated by the PHIDO algorithm, e.g. functions:
- To explore counts and alerts by geography
- To examine the trendtimes for a particular disease-region combination
- To aggregate analysis data based on gender
- ...  

This repo provides links to key documents and step-by-step instructions for different tasks required for maintaining the [PHIDO-App-2.1](https://bccdc.shinyapps.io/PHIDO/).

For data analysts, please refer to the [Standard Operating Procedure](sop.md)
